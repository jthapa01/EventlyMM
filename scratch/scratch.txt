Fixed the https cert error in docker by using this in docker-override
	
dotnet dev-certs https -ep "$env:USERPROFILE\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx"  -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$
dotnet dev-certs https --trust

      - ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password=bookify
      - ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx
    ports:
      - "8080"
      - "8081"
    volumes:
      - ${APPDATA}/Microsoft/UserSecrets:/root/.microsoft/usersecrets:ro
      - ~/.aspnet/https:/https:ro
      
Migration was not applied: There was existing data in the volume. Need to remove the existing data by
running the following command: Will allow postgres to initialize a new db
1. docker volume ls
2. docker volume inspect <volume-name>(contains path to directory) or docker volume prune to remove all volumes
3. (Remove-Item 'C:\path\to\your\directory' -Recurse -Force) in powershell
will remove from ./.containers/database in local machine or Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\.containers\database\*  in powershell
to remove from docker volume: delete manually from docker desktop on this path /var/lib/postgresql/data
when there is a code change then build the image. docker compose up -d -build. Else it will use the old image and may not reflect the changes
for migration.
None of the above worked for me and finally Using 172.18.0.2 worked for connecting to postgres db from app.

In same port postgres server can run in background. Check and stop the service so that 
docker can connect to in 5432 port or pick the different host port in docker-compose.yml.
Like 5433:5432 (host to container port mapping)
Win+R -> services.msc -> PostgreSQL Service -> Stop the service

Used 5433 for docker, coz 5432 was already in use by local postgres server
Connecting docker from Rider database or database tool: choose Host=localhost;Database=evently;Username=postgres;Password=password;Port=5433;

connecting docker db from application, the appsetting file should have: host: db service name in docker-compose.yml, port: 5433(host port), user: postgres, password: password, database: dbname
